- `git push`

## Instructions

_"Remember to use `git` on managing the changes you make to your program"_.

Building off from your last exercise, it's time for you **to combine it to your program**.

_Now you are done (technically)_. ðŸŽ‰

If you have an Internet connection, you can create your own GitHub repo for this exercise and push it there.

That will solidify your ability to push changes remotely. ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰
