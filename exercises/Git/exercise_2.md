## Instructions

_"Remember to use `git` on managing the changes you make to your program"_.

---

Following the first exercise, customize it to either the following two options:

- A Dentist Appointment Form
- A Hotel Reservation Form

**Branch it out from your main program**.

You can call the title and description anything you want. Just make sure it represents a business like _Unilab_ or you could think of a bad name like _Lyndon Dentals_.

Then include the following:

- List of names of the Doctor's or Room's available.
- An input to type those names.

You are then free to include additional things you like.
