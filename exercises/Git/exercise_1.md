We are going to create a simple form using Python.

You should provide a title and a brief description. The details the form should ask are:

- A date input that should include the day, month, and year.
- A time input (in 24 hour format, i.e. 13:00).

  > There's a `datetime` module you can import in Python with the functions `date()` and `datetime()`.

- The user's name.
- The user's email.

Upon completion, the program should display the following text:

```
Thank you for completing this form, [name].
```
